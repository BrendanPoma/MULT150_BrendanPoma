/*
 The 5 modifications i made to the parameters were:
- changed the shape of the particle system to square.
- changed color over time so that as the particles spawned by the end of their course they would be a different color.
- changed the starting size of the particles so that they would vary between different sizes at the start.
- used the curves editor to create more variation in size as the particles travel.
- changed the velocity over time to create an interesting route for the particles to travel on.
