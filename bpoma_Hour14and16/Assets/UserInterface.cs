 The modifications I made were:
- changed background image to that of a sapce theme.
- changed the color of the text on the button as well as its location, size, and color.
- created a title with unique sizing and font.
- added additional text with varying font style that give a theme to the game.
- used the background image to place text and button in interesting places that left the background image more open.
